	        <p>In addition to co-founding Wikipedia, Jimmy Wales has been involved in several other internet-related projects and initiatives. Here are some notable examples:
	            
	 <!-- <! -- this is list element to create list -- > -->
	            
	            <ul>
	            <li>Wikia: In 2004, Wales founded Wikia, a for-profit wiki hosting service that allows anyone to create and share content on various topics. The platform has grown to include more than 300,000 communities and has become one of the largest collaborative content creation platforms on the internet.
	            The People’s Operator: In 2012, Wales co-founded The People’s Operator (TPO), a mobile virtual network operator that aimed to donate a portion of its profits to various charitable causes. While the company struggled financially and eventually shut down in 2019, its mission and social impact have inspired other similar ventures in the telecommunications industry.
	            </li>
	            <li>WikiTribune: In 2017, Wales launched WikiTribune, a news website that aimed to provide high-quality, reliable, and transparent journalism by leveraging the collaborative power of the wiki model. While the site is no longer active, it has influenced the conversation around the future of journalism and the role of community-driven initiatives in shaping the media landscape.
	            </li>
	            <li>
	                Campaign for "social network neutrality" - a campaign to ensure that social networking sites do not restrict access to content based on the identity or beliefs of the user. Wales has spoken out against the use of algorithms to filter or prioritize content on social media platforms.
